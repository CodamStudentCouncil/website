    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">The voting process</h2>

    <p>
      When voting in an election, the following data is submitted to the server:
    </p>

    <ul class="ml-8 list-disc">
      <li>Your vote, with the general feedback from the form</li>
      <li>Your vote for each individual candidate, plus feedback</li>
      <li>A registration with your username letting us know you have voted</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The registration is kept separate from the votes and cleaned up after the
      election is over. Its only purpose is to stop you from voting more than once
      and it cannot be traced back to your vote.
